# kaggle-instacart

This is a repository of codes that I wrote while competing on the Instacart Market Basket Analysis competition on Kaggle which was live from 16th May, 2017 to 14th August, 2017. This solution finished 15th (public) / 22nd (private) on the leaderboard. 

This solution is a medley of Catboost, FFM and XGBoost models which are thresholded by maximizing F1 score using the exact algorithm and Monte-Carlo simulation.
